3- Write a name: name must exist in FNF FreePlay mode: `bopeebo`, `spookeez`, `pico`, etc...

4- Choose if you want osu! beatmap custom hitsounds (If map doesn't have any, don't check this)
  - Set volume of hitsounds (Recommended: 80-95%)

5- Player alternation: 
  - `Use Color Combos for alt players`: alternates every combo changes
  - `Use Randomness to alt players`: alternates with random algo, with max notes x player
  - `Only plays`: doesn't alternate, only select who plays
 
6- `Enemy & Player`: allows to change characters

7- `Speed`: set scroll speed, recommended: 1 on easy maps, 3 on insane

8- Click `Convert` and wait, if you checked "Use Custom Hitsounds", the process will take more time
