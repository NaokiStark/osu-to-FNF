osu! beatmap to Friday Night Funkin'

![](https://i.ibb.co/8YGnXgN/explorer-h5b-Y6-Xo-Hj-Q.png)

## How to

1- Select .osu beatmap located in osu!\Songs

2- Select FNF folder

3- Write a name: name must exist in FNF FreePlay mode (this replaces existing song and patterns)

4- Choose if you want osu! beatmap custom hitsounds (If map doesn't have any, don't check this)

5- Player alternation: 
  - `Use Color Combos for alt players`: alternates every combo changes
  - `Use Randomness to alt players`: alternates with random algo, with max notes x player
  - `Only plays`: doesn't alternate, only select who plays
 
6- `Enemy & Player`: allows to change characters

7- `Speed`: set scroll speed, recommended: 1 on easy maps, 3 on insane

8- Click `Convert` and wait, if you checked "Use Custom Hitsounds", the process will take more time

9- Test it with `Launch FNF`

### FAQ & Bugs

- **Beatmap doesn't convert**: don't use custom HitSounds, or beatmap is broken or something else
- **FNF crashes**: try to tweak values
